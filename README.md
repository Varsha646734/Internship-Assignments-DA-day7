This repository contains my daily internship assignments and projects.

## Objective
- Connect Python to a SQLite database
- Run SQL queries to get total quantity and revenue by product
- Display results using Pandas DataFrame
- Plot a simple bar chart using Matplotlib

## Steps
1. Created a database `sales_data.db` with sample sales table (run `sales_data_creator.py` once).
2. Ran SQL query inside Python using `sqlite3`.
3. Used `pandas` to load results and print summary.
4. Plotted revenue by product as a bar chart (`sales_chart.png`).
